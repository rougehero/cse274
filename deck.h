	 * Next, merge A and B back into a single deck. Take turns taking cards from the BOTTOM of A, 
	 * then from the BOTTOM of B.
	 *
	 * At each step, take either 0, 1, or 2 cards from the bottom of the deck you are working with, and put
	 * them on the bottom of deckList (the splice function may be useful here). This mimics the way a shuffle 
	 * actually works: Cards from the bottom of the two piles get dealt with first.
