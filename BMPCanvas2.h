 * Color : A simple class to help track BMP color triplets.
 * This is intended to help keep track of the tree color components, and is only an aid to programming --
 * not a full class.  Hence the data attributes have been left public, with the intent of being accessed directly.
 * The constructors are provided for convenience.  
 * Note that, for a 24-bit BMP, the order of color components is blue, then red, then green.

/***
 * BMP : The Windows Bitmap image format
 * BMP files are binary files that represent color images. In this assignment you won't need to know much
 * about them, except for the following:
 * A BMP file consists of a 54-byte header, followed by 3*width*height bytes of data.
 * I have provided two methods, readHeader and writeHeader, which should handle the header: You should not
 * have to worry about it. As for the rest: Each pixel of the image is represented by 3 bytes of data.
 * A byte is an 8-bit integer, so each byte represents a number between 0 and 255. Each pixel is made up
 * of a triple of these: For a 24-bit BMP, first is blue, then green, then red. 
 * So, for example, the triple (0, 0, 0) represents black, (255, 255, 255) represents white, 
 * (255, 0, 0) represents blue, (0, 255, 255) represents yellow, and so on.
 * Much more about RGB colors can be found by searching online.
 *
 * The key point is that, for each pixel of the image, you will want to call the write() method of your ofstream
 * three times, printing the three color values that will define the point's color.
