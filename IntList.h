 * Purpose  : The IntList class implements a linked list of integers, as described by our textbook.
 *            This file also declares IntListNode, which is a class that represents a single node of
 *            an IntList, and a stand-alone function called splice that will be useful in Phase02.
 * Note     : DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE!!! All code should be in you IntList.cpp

/*
 * When you have a pointer variable that is not pointing to anything, you should always set it to NULL.
 * Before you use a pointer, you should always assert that it is != NULL. That way you will avoid one of
 * the number one pitfalls of C++: Losing track of which pointers are valid!
 */

/*
 * The node class is what actually makes up the list. The IntListNode class works together
 * with the list class: The IntList class function simply manipulates nodes in order to
 * make the necessary modifications to the list.
 */
class IntListNode {

	 * Initialize data to -1, and also initialize prev and next. See Section 3.1.1 of the textbook if you
	 * don't know what prev and next should be initialized to.

/*
 * Splice is definied on page 62 of the textbook. Note that it is not very hard to translate
 * the book's code into C++. You should not, however, call your variables things
 * like "a" and "b" ... that is really confusing, and terrible style!
 *
 * Note that splice is not a member function of IntList, but a separate function. The purpose of splice
 * is to take two lists, and perform surgery on them to move one chunk of list from one list to another.
 * Please see the assertions on page 62 ... you will notice that there are a lot of conditions that must
 * hold in order for splicing to be safe!
 *
 * Comment for Phase02: Splice can be very helpful in implementing the shuffle and cut methods of Deck in Phase02.
